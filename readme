This guide explains how to install the test signing certificate on a Windows machine so that test-signed drivers are trusted and can be loaded without warnings.

## Import the Test Certificate (.pfx file)

You should have the exported `.pfx` file (e.g., `EzAntiAntiCheatCert.pfx`) available on your target PC.

### Steps:

1. Press **Win + R**, type `certmgr.msc`, and press **Enter** to open Certificate Manager.

2. In the left pane, expand **Personal** → **Certificates**.

3. Right-click on **Certificates** under **Personal**, then select **All Tasks** → **Import...**

4. In the Certificate Import Wizard:
   - Click **Next**.
   - Click **Browse** to select your `.pfx` file.
   
5. Enter the password for the `.pfx` file when prompted:

   ```
   NjA2N0FFNTU4NjNCMEY5Q0ZFRjFBMkU5NDQ3MURDNjlGN0ZBODVCQg
   ```

6. Make sure **"Mark this key as exportable"** is checked, then click **Next**.

7. Choose to place the certificate in the **Personal** store if not already selected.

8. Click **Next**, then **Finish** to complete the import.

## Add the Certificate to Trusted Root Certification Authorities

To make Windows trust this certificate for driver signing:

### Steps:

1. In Certificate Manager, expand **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** → **Certificates**.

2. Right-click **Certificates** under this store, then select **All Tasks** → **Import...**

3. Browse for the same `.pfx` file or export the certificate without the private key as a `.cer` file and import that instead.

4. Complete the wizard (no password needed if importing `.cer`).

## Add the Certificate to Trusted Publishers

To ensure software signed with this certificate is trusted:

### Steps:

1. In Certificate Manager, expand **Trusted Publishers** → **Certificates**.

2. Right-click **Certificates** under **Trusted Publishers**, then select **All Tasks** → **Import...**

3. Import the `.cer` file exported earlier or directly the `.pfx` (without private key).

4. Complete the wizard.

## Enable Test Signing Mode

To allow Windows to load test-signed drivers:

### Steps:

1. Open an **elevated Command Prompt** (Run as Administrator) and run:

   ```cmd
   bcdedit /set testsigning on
   ```

2. Restart your computer.

### Verification:

After reboot, verify test signing mode is active by running:

```cmd
bcdedit /enum
```

Look for:

```
testsigning          Yes
```

**Note:** Keep your `.pfx` password safe. Without it, you cannot use the private key to sign drivers on other machines.
